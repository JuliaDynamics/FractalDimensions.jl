A Julia package that estimates various definitions of fractal dimension from data, including so-called "local dimensions and extremal indices" via extreme value theory.
It can be used as a standalone package, or as part of
[DynamicalSystems.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalSystems.jl/dev/).

To install it, run `import Pkg; Pkg.add("FractalDimensions")`.

All further information is provided in the documentation, which you can either find [online](https://juliadynamics.github.io/FractalDimensions.jl/stable/) or build locally by running the `docs/make.jl` file.

_Previously, this package was part of ChaosTools.jl._

## Publication

FractalDimensions.jl is used in a review article comparing various estimators for fractal dimensions. The paper is likely a relevant read if you are interested in the package. And if you use the package, please cite the paper.
